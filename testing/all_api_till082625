They were individually housed in mouse drawer system (MDS, 11.6 x 9.8 x 8.4 cm), which is a payload developed by Alenia-Space. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. These mice were launched by Space Shuttle Discovery (space transport system, STS-128) at August 28, 2009. They were housed in Japanese Experimental Module (Kibou) on the ISS until they returned to the Earth by Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-129) on November 27, 2009. Only one mouse returned to the Earth alive. Whole brain was sampled from the mouse killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Sciences Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3-4 hours after landing. After the spaceflight experiment, the on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova, Italy. A mouse with the same species, sex, and age was housed in MDS for 3 months as the ground control (GC). Another mouse was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC). Amount of food and water supplementation and environmental conditions were simulated as the flight group. After 3 months, brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC, respectively.     Approximately 100mg of brain tissue from each of the snap-frozen mouse whole brain samples were collected, and total RNA was extracted by RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol provided in the kit (QIAGEN, cat#74903).     1 ug of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using T7-oligo-dT primer and produced cDNA was double-stranded by Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, cat#AM1753). From ds-cDNA, aRNA was amplified and labeled with amino allyl UTP, and then Cy5-coupling to amino allyl modified aRNA was carried out according to the instruction of the Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit.     5 ug of the purified Cy5-aRNA sample was dissolved in 100 ul of hybridization solution (CombiMatrix CustomArray 12K Hybridization and Imaging Protocol: PTL006), and hybridization reaction was carried out at 45 C for 16hours. 70 Negative control probes (derived from bacteria, plants, and bacteriophages) were spotted, and 326 factory QC probes were also spotted on the microarray. In addition, there were 148 empty (blank) spots available for background signal measurement.  Therefore, signal data from total of 544 control spots were included in 12,544-spot data on the custom-designed Mus musculus 12K oligo DNA microarray.     The raw data (Mm_B-GC_RawData_for_GEO.txt, Mm_B-LC_RawData_for_GEO.txt, and Mm_B-SF_RawData_for_GEO.txt) were obtained from the scanned images using MicroarrayImager ver.6.0.1 (CombiMatrix Corp.), and were background-subtracted and median-normalized by Microsoft Office Excel 2003 within each of the microarray. We employed simple fold-difference calculation using Microsoft Office Excel 2003 for each of the spot intensities between GC:LC, GC:SF, and LC:SF. Since sample number (n) was 1 for all of the condition groups, there was no application of statistical analysis for this data processing.     The microarrays went through post-hybridization washes according to CombiMatrix CustomArray 12K Hybridization and Imaging Protocol (PTL006), and they were scaned by Axon Instruments' GenePix 4000B scanner (5 um resolution, PMT gain at 500, Laser power at 100%).

Wild type mice (n equals 3) were launched by Space Shuttle Discovery and housed on the International Space Station (ISS) for 91 days. They returned to the Earth by Space Shuttle Atlantis. But only one mouse returned to the Earth alive. Whole brain was sampled from the mouse killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Sciences Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3-4 hours after landing. After the spaceflight experiment, the on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova, Italy. A mouse with the same species, sex, and age was housed in mice drawer system (MDS), which was utilized for the spaceflight (SF) mice, for 3 months as the ground control (GC). Another mouse was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC). Amount of food and water supplementation and environmental conditions were simulated as the flight group. After 3 months, brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC, respectively. Comprehensive analyses of gene expression were performed in the right brain. Total of 4,000 genes were analyzed. The expression levels of 60 genes significantly changed in response to SF compared with LC and/or GC. The 15 and 16 genes were up- (greater than 2 folds) and down-regulated (less than 0.5 folds), respectively, following SF vs. GC. The levels of 58 genes were significantly altered by housing in MDS in space and/or on the ground. Forty seven and 11 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated vs. LC. Twenty seven out of these genes responded to caging in MDS both in space and on the ground. Further, 31 genes were influenced by housing in MDS on the Earth. Responses of the characteristics of brain to long-term gravitational unloading were investigated in mice.', 'organism': 'Mus musculus', 'Data Source Type': 'cgene'}, 'highlight': {'all': ['Gene responses in <em>mouse</em> brain to long-term exposure to microgravity', 'Only one <em>mouse</em> returned to the Earth alive.', 'Another <em>mouse</em> was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC).', 'But only one <em>mouse</em> returned to the Earth alive.', '<em>cgene</em>']}}]}
